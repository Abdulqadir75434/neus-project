    <strong>Introduction</strong>
    <p>Climate change is traceable to man-made degradation of the natural and social environment over the last hundred years. A severe impact of such change, including extreme weather events, droughts, and famines, has resulted in millions of people fleeing their homes; the shortage of important micronutrients; war and struggles over scarce resources; and mental health deterioration as a result of failed attempts to address these challenges are all being felt throughout the world. Human and planetary health are inextricably interwoven. <br><br>

        Unsurprisingly, the poor and weakest sections of societies bear the brunt, as they can neither prepare for nor adapt to such changes. Women and girls are naturally, societally, culturally, and economically at risk in times of danger, and they suffer the most from extreme weather, food insecurity, and epidemics. In the current paper, published in the journal Nursing Outlook, female health and well-being against a setting of climate change is the point of interest. <br><br>
        
        The researchers identified five key areas of vulnerability among females due to their biology and social factors. These are access to food and water, migration, gender-based violence, infectious disease, and reproductive/sexual health. In addition, women are known to have less access to health care and are less likely to enjoy fundamental human rights anywhere in the world <br><br>
        
        This awareness of the existing and expanding gender gap in the ability to prepare for and respond to the crises caused by climate change drove the current study. The researchers hope it will help shape better strategies, actively seeking input and leadership from women and girls, to help communities and families respond to climate change, preserving and even bettering their lives. <br><br>

       <strong>What did the study show?</strong>
       <p>The lack of water for drinking and cleaning makes it difficult for women to carry out their duties since they are largely responsible for home and family worldwide. The collection of firewood and fodder, tasks hardly ever undertaken by men irrespective of the availability of time, has become an enormous challenge due to deforestation, draining scarce time and energy as girls have to walk farther and work harder. <br><br><br>

        The same is the case with water pollution, drought, and floods. In addition, the difficulty in accessing drinking water encourages waterborne diseases and those due to poor hygiene. The latter again is worsened, for females and small children, by the increased need for water during many critical phases of their lives, driven by female biology. Females typically get the last and the least turn at eating, compromising their health throughout childhood and the reproductive period of life. Food insecurity has become rampant in many areas of the world, with obvious harm to those already at risk. This leaves women malnourished and unable to lead meaningful and productive lives or to produce and raise healthy offspring. Migration is speeding up due to the frequent and intense environ</p>
